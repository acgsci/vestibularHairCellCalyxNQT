# vestibularHairCellCalyxNQT
Welcome to the file repository for the research paper: 
***"Nonquantal Transmission at the Vestibular Hair Cell-Calyx Synapse: KLV Currents Modulate Fast Electrical and Slow K+ Potentials"***

**Paper Status:** Accepted by PNAS. Awaiting Publication. [Link will be added here once the article is posted]

An older preprint of the text is available at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.18.469197v1

**Repository Status:** 

Model files used to generate the data in the paper are available ("Draft 12" series). A PDF of the Supporting Information is also provided: "2022-12-11 Supporting Information.pdf". A cleaned and updated template file is also provided: "2022-12-05 VHCC Model Template.mph". Optional files to help with figure generation or linking with matlab are also available. Please see below.

For questions, assistance, or bug reports please feel free to contact me at: user@domain.edu ; user = ag105; domain = rice.

**Requirements:**
1) The base Comsol Multiphysics software package (https://www.comsol.com/).
2) (Optional) The Matlab Livelink addon for Comsol Multiphysics.

The provided .mph files can be opened with the base package of Comsol.
Remember to compute the solution after accessing the model files for the first time.

Optional Files:
Two types of matlab files are provided:
1) (_Upload pending_) Figure generating files (.m) - These files generate matlab figures of the data presented in the paper and require the use of the Matlab Livelink addon to interface between comsol and matlab. Please note that you may have to update file paths within the scripts to work with your downloaded files.
2) Figures (.fig) 

Adobe Illustrator was used to layout the different plots generated using matlab and to improve visual representation of the data.
