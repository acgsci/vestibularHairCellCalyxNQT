Welcome to the file repository for the research paper: 
***"Nonquantal Transmission at the Vestibular Hair Cell-Calyx Synapse: KLV Currents Modulate Fast Electrical and Slow K+ Potentials in the Synaptic Cleft"***

***Status: Awaiting peer review.***
An older preprint of the text is available at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.18.469197v1

**Requirements:**
1) The base Comsol Multiphysics software package (https://www.comsol.com/).
2) (Optional) The Matlab Livelink addon for Comsol Multiphysics.

**The main model file is: "2022-18-04 NQT Model File - Small Size - ACG"**

You will be able to open this with just the base package of Comsol. This file was the template file which was modified for all other variations.
Remember to compute the solution after accessing the model file for the first time.

Some matlab files are also provided. These files generate matlab figures of the data presented in the paper.
The final images were generated by using Adobe Illustrator to layout the different plots and improve visual representation of the data.
