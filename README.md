Welcome to the file repository for the research paper: 
***"Nonquantal Transmission at the Vestibular Hair Cell-Calyx Synapse: KLV Currents Modulate Fast Electrical and Slow K+ Potentials in the Synaptic Cleft"***

**Paper Status:** Awaiting peer review.

An older preprint of the text is available at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.18.469197v1

**Repository Status:** Main model file available. Additional file uploads pending

**The main model file is: "2022-18-04 NQT Model File - Small Size - ACG.mph"**

**Requirements:**
1) The base Comsol Multiphysics software package (https://www.comsol.com/).
2) (Optional) The Matlab Livelink addon for Comsol Multiphysics.

You will be able to open this with just the base package of Comsol. This file was the template file which was modified for all other variations.
Remember to compute the solution after accessing the model file for the first time.

Two types of matlab files are provided (_Upload pending_):
1) Figure generating files (.m) - These files generate matlab figures of the data presented in the paper and require the use of the Matlab Livelink addon to interface between comsol and matlab. 
2) Figures (.fig) 
 
Adobe Illustrator was used to layout the different plots generated using matlab and to improve visual representation of the data.
